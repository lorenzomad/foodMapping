Making a map of food highlighting the relationships and similarities between foods and which ones are the most used together

The project idea is to find similarities between different foods and find which ones are often used together in recipes. This could highlight similarities between foods that are not commonly used together in recipes and open the ground for new combinations.

# How

The map will be built by obtaining first a dataset of recipes (possibly from different cultures), etracting the ingredients, cleaning the data and creating a map of similarity between the foods through ML techniques. The desired output would be to create an (interactive) image that groups together similar foods and highlights (through weighted lines) which ones are commonly used together.
